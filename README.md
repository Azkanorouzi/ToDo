‚úèÔ∏è¬†How to use it:

- click on the navbar plus button and enter the info to add a new project/environment to the navbar
- click on the right hand side plus button to add a new task to the display panel
- You can hit on the ? to see the info of a certain task
- by clicking on the ||| you can see the other options
- you can move (not yet ready), edit, delete a task
- if the circle is red that means the task is important if yellow semi-important and if green it‚Äôs less important than the other tasks, this will cause the task to appear lower than more important ones in other words red circle tasks appear at the top then yellow circle tasks and then green circle tasks
- You can choose between 4 themes by clicking on the theme circles above nav

ü™≤- Bugs and things that must be fixed:

- Saving the information between renders (the application doesn‚Äôt have backend)
- Mobile version has a couple of bugs and not usable for now
- Moving tasks feature
